# Battleship - The Next Generation

September 08, 2018

This was my first decent project while attending The Turing School of Software & Design. I had been coding ruby for ~3 weeks at the time. Looking back at this repo, I can't believe how far I've come and how little I understood at the time.

My goal is to eventually refactor this early work as practice.

My development journey has continued, I'm about 4 years in. This code was orginally written ~2 weeks into learning to code. This repo has always been in the back of my mind to refactor. I'm refactoring this repo as general refactoring and OOP practice...and to relieve myself of the burden of previously terrible code.

## Instructions

- Clone repo
- cd into `/battleship` directory
- to run battleship, execute `$ ruby lib/battleship.rb`

Best of luck.
