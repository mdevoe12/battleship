# Battleship - The Next Generation

September 08, 2018

This was my first decent project while attending The Turing School of Software & Design. I had been coding ruby for ~3 weeks at the time. Looking back at this repo, I can't believe how far I've come and how little I understood at the time.

My goal is to eventually refactor this early work as practice.

## Instructions

- Clone repo
- cd into `/battleship` directory
- to run battleship, execute `$ ruby lib/battleship.rb`

Best of luck.
